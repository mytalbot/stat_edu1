The repository contains working material for a basic course in statistics using the software GraphPad Prism.
There are 3 files:
•	a PDF with a selection of statistical tests in form of a decision tree
•	an MS-Excel file with a selection of statistical exercises (for playing around in Prism)
•	the encrypted slides (PDF) of the corresponding course (if you need the password, send me request via email)
